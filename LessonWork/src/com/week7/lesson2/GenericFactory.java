// interfaces are implemented not instantiated 
// abstract classes must define at least one abstract method
// non abstract methods have a defined body
// interface defines a contract an abstract class is looser 
// use abstract classes when you have a lot of similar but slightly different objects
// interfaces are good for making people use the methods where the objects are very different
